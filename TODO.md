Continuous deployment with port reassignment
Add a timestamp to articles
Add an "updated at" value in frontpage (use PSQL table for this)
Check to see if default timestamp is missing timezone info
Check to see if timezones are accurate for Mercurio, etc. if not, make them
Daily log rotation with backup (make script)
 

Add inegration tests (check `rel/env.sh.eex` as a way of maybe running checks on startup)
